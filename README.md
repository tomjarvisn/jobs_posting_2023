# Analysis of Remote Data Jobs üíºüåê


## Introduction üöÄ
In this project, I analyzed a database of job postings from 2023 related to 'Data' jobs scraped by [Luke Barousse](https://github.com/lukebarousse).

## Background üìä
The [database](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1moeWYoUtUklJO6NJdWo9OV8zWjRn0rjN) used for this analysis follows the structure depicted below:
![Data structure](images\table_structure.png)
and the queries from the [sql_load](/sql_load/) folder were utilized.


## Tools Used üîß
- PostgreSQL: For data storage and querying
- SQL: For data manipulation and analysis
- Visual Studio Code: For coding and writing queries
- Git: Pushing the proyect to github to share it to the comunity


## Analysis üìà

### Query 1: Remote Job Post Ratio by Job Title

#### *"Exploring the Prevalence of Remote Work Across Data Roles"*

```sql
-- Subquery to calculate total job posts by job title
WITH job_posts_count AS (
    SELECT
        job_title_short AS job_title,
        CAST(COUNT(*) AS FLOAT) AS job_posts,
        AVG(salary_year_avg)/12 as month_salary
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    GROUP BY
        job_title_short
),

-- Subquery to calculate remote job posts by job title
remote_job_posts_count AS (
    SELECT
        job_title_short AS job_title,
        CAST(COUNT(*) AS FLOAT) AS remote_job_posts
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    WHERE
        job_work_from_home = TRUE
    GROUP BY
        job_title_short
)

-- Main query to calculate remote job post ratio and present results
SELECT
    jp.job_title,
    jp.job_posts,
    rjp.remote_job_posts,
    CONCAT(ROUND(CAST((rjp.remote_job_posts / jp.job_posts * 100) AS NUMERIC), 2), '%') AS remote_post_ratio,
    ROUND(jp.month_salary::NUMERIC, 2) as month_salary
FROM
    job_posts_count AS jp
JOIN
    remote_job_posts_count AS rjp ON jp.job_title = rjp.job_title
ORDER BY
    job_posts DESC;

```

## Conclusions üéâ
- If you are new to the data industry, there are lots of opportunities for remote work, particularly in the U.S., where companies offer a whopping 41.84% of remote 'data' job postings in the market.
- Proficiency in key skills like Python or SQL is vital to consider in the data processing world.
- When we check the 'Remote Work Ratio' in Query 6, the ratio is remarkably high. From my point of view, the reason so many companies offer remote work is because they have trouble finding people skilled in data-related tasks. However, this presents an opportunity if you are interested in this field!
